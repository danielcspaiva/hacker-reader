I want to redesign the tabbar like this:

- Feed
- Bookmarks
- Settings
- Search

All the other screens (ask, top, etc) would be the same (feed), that would have a zeego native context menu (check todo 11) where the user can pick the current category for the feed.

For now just create the Bookmarks and settings screens, don't worry about the functionality
