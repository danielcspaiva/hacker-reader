# Comment Feature Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Feature:** HN Comment Posting for Authenticated Users

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented the comment posting feature according to the **Improved Authentication Implementation Plan** (Phase 2.3). Users can now post comments on HN stories directly from the mobile app.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend (Already Complete)

The following were already implemented from previous work:

- ‚úÖ **Comment API Function** (`packages/shared/src/api/hn-write-api.ts`)
  - `comment(parentId, text, session)` - Posts a comment to HN
  - Fetches HMAC token from parent item page
  - POSTs form-encoded data to HN's `/comment` endpoint
  - Includes rate limiting and error handling

- ‚úÖ **HTML Parser** (`packages/shared/src/auth/parsers.ts`)
  - `parseCommentFormHmac(html)` - Extracts HMAC from comment form
  - Smart error detection for session expiration
  - Proper error codes for different failure scenarios

- ‚úÖ **Error Handling** (`packages/shared/src/auth/errors.ts`)
  - `HNAuthError` class with typed error codes
  - `isAuthError()` type guard for error checking
  - Error codes: NOT_LOGGED_IN, RATE_LIMITED, PARSE_ERROR, etc.

### 2. Frontend UI (Newly Implemented)

Added comprehensive comment UI to `apps/mobile/app/story/[id].tsx`:

#### **UI Components**

1. **Comment Button in Header**
   - Shows only for authenticated users
   - Toggles comment input visibility
   - Icon changes from `bubble.left` (closed) to `xmark.circle` (open)

2. **Comment Input Form**
   - Multi-line text input (80-120px height range)
   - Character limit: 5,000 characters
   - Shows HN markdown support hint
   - Disabled during posting
   - Styled with theme colors (adapts to dark/light mode)

3. **Post Comment Button**
   - HN orange color (#FF6600)
   - Shows "Posting..." state during submission
   - Disabled when empty or posting
   - Opacity effect when disabled

4. **Keyboard Handling**
   - `KeyboardAvoidingView` wrapper for iOS/Android
   - Adjusts content padding when keyboard appears
   - Proper keyboard offset (90px on iOS)

#### **State Management**

- React Query `useMutation` for comment posting
- Local state for comment text and input visibility
- Query invalidation on success to refresh comments
- Optimistic UI with loading states

#### **Error Handling**

Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly alerts:

- **Session Expired**: Logs out user and prompts re-login
- **Rate Limited**: Shows "slow down" message
- **Parse Error**: Suggests app update may be needed
- **Generic Errors**: Fallback error messages

#### **Success Flow**

1. User clicks comment button in header
2. Comment input slides up from bottom
3. User types comment (with markdown support)
4. User clicks "Post Comment"
5. Loading state shows "Posting..."
6. On success:
   - Input clears and hides
   - Story data refreshes (showing new comment)
   - Success alert appears

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`apps/mobile/app/story/[id].tsx`** (Main implementation)
   - Added imports: `comment`, `useHNAuth`, `useMutation`, error types
   - Added UI components: `TextInput`, `Alert`, `KeyboardAvoidingView`
   - Added state: `commentText`, `isCommentInputVisible`
   - Added mutation: `commentMutation` with full error handling
   - Added UI: Comment button in header + floating input form
   - Added styles: 7 new style definitions

### No Changes Needed

- ‚úÖ Shared package already exports everything correctly
- ‚úÖ Auth context already provides session management
- ‚úÖ Theme already has all required colors (including `border`)
- ‚úÖ Type checking passes without errors

---

## User Experience

### For Authenticated Users

1. **Commenting on Stories**
   - Tap comment icon (üí¨) in story header
   - Comment input slides up from bottom
   - Type comment with HN markdown support
   - Tap "Post Comment" button
   - See success message and refreshed comments

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Button shows loading state during posting
   - Input disabled during posting
   - Alert on success/error
   - Smooth keyboard handling

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Session expired ‚Üí Prompted to log in again
   - Rate limited ‚Üí Told to slow down
   - Network error ‚Üí Retry prompt

### For Unauthenticated Users

- Comment button not shown in header
- No changes to existing UI
- Can still read comments normally

---

## Technical Details

### API Flow

```
1. User taps "Post Comment"
2. Mutation calls comment(storyId, text, session)
3. API fetches story page to get HMAC token
4. API POSTs to /comment with form data:
   - parent: <storyId>
   - hmac: <extracted_token>
   - text: <user_comment>
5. HN processes comment and returns response
6. App refreshes story data to show new comment
```

### Error Handling Flow

```typescript
onError: (error) => {
  if (isAuthError(error)) {
    switch (error.code) {
      case "NOT_LOGGED_IN": // Clear session, prompt login
      case "RATE_LIMITED":  // Show "slow down" message
      case "PARSE_ERROR":   // Suggest app update
      default:              // Generic error message
    }
  }
}
```

### Styling Approach

- Uses theme colors for consistency
- Adapts to light/dark mode automatically
- HN orange (#FF6600) for primary action
- Proper safe area handling (iOS notch, Android nav bar)
- Platform-specific adjustments

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **Story-Level Comments Only**
   - Can only comment on the story itself
   - Cannot reply to individual comments (yet)
   - This is Phase 1 as per the plan

2. **No Comment Preview**
   - Markdown is not previewed before posting
   - User sees raw markdown in input
   - HN will render it after posting

3. **No Edit/Delete**
   - Cannot edit comments after posting
   - Cannot delete comments
   - Deferred to future versions per plan

### Future Enhancements (Not in v1)

From the improved plan, these are deferred:

- ‚ùå **Reply to Comments** - Different UI pattern needed
- ‚ùå **Edit Comments** - 2-hour window, added complexity
- ‚ùå **Delete Comments** - Low priority
- ‚ùå **Markdown Preview** - Would require markdown renderer
- ‚ùå **Draft Saving** - Auto-save in-progress comments
- ‚ùå **Comment Templates** - Quick responses

## How to Use (User Guide)

### Posting a Comment

1. **Log in to HN** (Settings ‚Üí Login to HN)
2. **Open any story** from the feed
3. **Tap the comment icon** (üí¨) in the top right
4. **Type your comment** in the input field
5. **Tap "Post Comment"** to submit
6. **Wait for success message** - Your comment appears!

### Markdown Support

HN supports basic markdown:

```
*italic*
**bold**
`code`
Links: [text](url)
Paragraphs: Double newline
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Session Expired"**
- Your login expired
- Tap "OK" and log in again

**"Slow Down"**
- You're posting too quickly
- Wait a few seconds and try again

**"Something Went Wrong"**
- HN may have changed
- Try again later or update the app
